  <h2> Work Experience. </h2>
    <p> I like languages, it is a way to know different people and it's culture, and I've been using my abilities to accomplish different goals throughout my carrer. Here you'll find 
        more info about what I've done and am currently doing.

  <h2> Web development portfolio. </h2>
    <p>Great things don't come easy, I will post my progress in the programing world here.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This is how I want my website to look like in the future, I want to have a website that is divided into different folders and that can be scrolled to the sides, I don't know if that's 
      possible yet</p>
